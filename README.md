This is a voting app written with Full-Stack JavaScript. Authenticated users can create multiple-choice polls, delete polls, and vote once on everyone's polls. All users can view everyone's polls.

This project was made with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB with Passport authentication on the back end. The front end is written in React with Redux and is based off of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). The code for Passport authentication was based off of Stephen Grider's Udemy Course on [Advanced React and Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux-tutorial/).
